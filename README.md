# constrained-docking

Overview 
Both Autodock Vina (ADV) and rDock are molecular docking program useful for computer aided drug design
In this tutorial we will learn how to run MCS and pharmacophore based constrained docking on vina and rDock.

Requirements
rdkit,Openbabel, rDock and ADV.


Usage
1) Selection of 9 ligands from high troughput screening

2) Using rdkit Chem library, determined maximum common substructure (MCS) shared between each the fragments, by comparing  one against 8 remains.
